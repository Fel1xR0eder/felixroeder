                I am a Front-end developer based near Leipzig, Germany. I enjoy helping designers
                and companies bring their ideas into real life.
                I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web developer
                position. <br> <br>
                If you think I'd be a good match for your projects, contact me!
