        I am a Front-end developer based in Munich, Germany. I enjoy helping designers 
        and companies bring their ideas into real life. 
        I am looking forward to continuing my developer career with a job in a junior web developer
        position. <br> <br>
        If you think I'd be a good match for your projects, contact me!
